An Introduction to JavaScript and Linked Data WS 2015/16 Project
This project attempts to convert Migration data from the City Council of Münster into open data and link it to other relevant sources such as households and visualise the results on a map using Javascript. The variation of migrant population is visualised on a map grouped by each borough with the help of barplots.
