                <h2>The Map</h2>
                <p>
                    The map is the central tool to request data about the city, boroughs and districts of Muenster. On start
                    you can see the different districts and therefor the most fine grained visualization possible on this
                    website. With the button in the top right corner you can switch between different base maps but also
                    switch between the different city levels. This makes it possible to choose the data you want to focus on.
                    If you click on a part of Muenster you get infornation in the area right beside the map. This data
                    contains the name, a wikipedia link to get mor information, and especially data about migration for this
                    area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you click on an are using the right mouse button a context menu opens and you have the possibility to
                    add the click area to a comparison. The data about this are will than be accessible on the information
                    panel on the right. <br>
                    With the contextmenu it is also possible to directly zoom to a specific are or reset the zoom to
                    complete muenster.
                </p>
                <h2>The Information panel</h2>
                <p>
                    The information panel is the area on the right side of the map, which shows the data after a specific
                    area was click. This area gives several possibilities to use the data. These will be explained now:
                </p>
                <h3>The Chart</h3>
                <p>
                    The chart is based on higharts and loads the data based on what is choosen in the dropdown menu, which
                    opens if "Choose data for chart" is clicked. After clicking the button, the data is direcly loaded from
                    the database and shown in the chart. If you hover over the different cloumns you can get information
                    about the exact value and the year this value was measured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you use the chart for a comparison this works exactly the same but multiple areas are loaded to the
                    chart and are visualized beside each other.
                </p>
                <h3>The Export function</h3>
                <p>
                    With a click on the "Export Information" button it is possible to get the plain data from the database
                    and use it in any way you like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After clicking the button a formular opens were you can choose the data you want to be exported.
                    Please choose for every category at least one value to get the export started.
                    After clicking on export the result is logged in the browser console ready to be copied and used as
                    ever you like.
                </p>
                <h2>The Tour</h2>
                <p>
                    The tour button is only available if you are on the map page. It is based on the intro.js library and
                    really easy to understand. If you click on the button a certain part of the website is highlighted and
                    explained. After that you can change to the next important are and have that explained.
                </p>

                <h2>The data and database</h2>
                <p>
                    The data on this website is focused on the migration itself and people you are living in Muenster
                    and have a migration background. This can be personal migration or inherited migration if the parents
                    or grandparents migrated from another country to Muenster.
                </p>
